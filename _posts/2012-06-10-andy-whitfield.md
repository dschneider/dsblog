title: 'Be Here Now - The Andy Whitfield Story'

I am a huge fan of the TV show **Spartacus: Blood and Sand. **My girlfriend
stumbled across this documentary that is currently being produced. It's about
the main actor of the TV show, Andy Whitfield, who died in 2011 (at the age of
39 years) because of Non Hodgkin's Lymphoma. Andy was a truly inspiring human
being. Check out the trailer above. You can also pledge money on
[Kickstarter](http://www.kickstarter.com/projects/426354716/be-here-now-the-
andy-whitfield-story?ref=live) to fund the project.

From the project's description:

“Be Here Now” is an inspiring feature documentary and love story, about the
overnight sensation, actor and international sex symbol Andy Whitfield, who
put the same determination and dedication that he brought to his lead role in
the hit television show, “Spartacus: Blood and Sand,” into fighting life
threatening cancer.

This is Andy's story, but it also about having the courage to make your dreams
come true, tackling your fears and living in the present, despite the
potential outcome. This film is for anyone who has ever faced a challenge in
their lives.
