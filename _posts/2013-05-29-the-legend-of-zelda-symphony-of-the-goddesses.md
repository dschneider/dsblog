Yesterday my girlfriend and me went to the concert 'The Legend of Zelda -
Symphony of the Goddesses' performed by the Babelsberger Symphony Orchestra in
the Tempodrom in Berlin. I didn't expect too much from it but in the end I was
really overwhelmed by the performance. I expected it to be a rather smallish
concert but it was very epic. This was also due to the many Zelda fans that
went to the concert. I am not a **huge** fan of Zelda myself, in fact I haven't
played anything past 'Ocarina of Time' at all but I was playing 'A Link to the
Past' a lot during my childhood and with the music all the memories came back.
I can highly recommend it. Next stop: Final Symphony from Final Fantasy!
