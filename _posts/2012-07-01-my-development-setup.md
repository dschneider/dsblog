This is what I am currently using for software development on my MacBook Air
running Lion.


## All around coding

* VIM - the ultimate code editor, setup with this nice script, made by my colleague Txus: [https://github.com/codegram/vimfiles](https://github.com/codegram/vimfiles)
* I started using Ack for doing search ([http://betterthangrep.com/](http://betterthangrep.com/)) <strike>Sublime Text 2 - I am still using Sublime Text 2 for global search and replacement and also for quick browsing, but for everything else I completely rely on VIM</strike>
* Code Runner (Appstore) - Good to execute code quickly, I use it a lot for small tests in Ruby and Lua. It helped me a lot to understand metaprogramming by playing around with Modules, Classes and whatnot
* Code Box (Appstore) - For storing code snippets
* Gist - For sharing code snippets
* Reggy - An awesome regular expression viewer and tester
* iTerm2 - A terminal substitution
* Git + GitHub + GitTower
* RVM - For easy installation and maintenance of different Ruby environments


## Databases

* MongoHub - Native app for MongoDB databases
* SequelPro - Native app for MySQL databases
* SQLVue - An app for SQLite databases
* pgAdmin3 - App for maintaining Postgres databases


## Convenient helpers

* Homebrew - I just miss Linux so much
* Balsamiq Mockups - Well, for creating mockups, as the title says
* MindNode Lite (Appstore) - For visualizing mindmaps
* xDiagram Pro (Appstore) - For all kinds of Diagrams
* HTTPClient (Appstore) - CURL is too much pain, use this GUI app instead
* ForkLift (Appstore) - File manager and FTP client 
* Alfred (Appstore) - For quick execution of commands, file searches, snippets and clipboard access with history


## Organization

* Wunderlist & Wunderkit - For keeping track of my open source projects and to-dos
* Evernote - For taking notes on all kinds of stuff. I store a lot of articles about algorithms, databases & cache and software architecture in there
