**What is XBMC?**

XBMC Media Center is an open source media center solution for playing videos,
music and showing pictures from DVD, hard disk, server and streams from the
net. XBMC categorizes and organizes the media in a really beautiful way. For
example XBMC fetches information about a movie or TV shows from IMDB and gets
fanart content for music, movies and puts it right onto your screen. XBMC was
initially developed for Microsoft's Gaming Console XBox - hence the original
name XBox Media Center.

You can scan your media library using so called "scrapers" which detect
details about the movie / TV show by scanning the title of the file on your
hard disk. XBMC automatically fetches the description, trailers, episode names
and artists from the movies and TV shows, which you can use for searching
afterwards - e. g. you can display all movies of Arnold Schwarzenegger at
once! Awesome feature! It also loads the covers of your favorite music.

XBMC also has some other useful stuff like a weather plugin which shows the
current weather in your city and region or an integrated RSS reader for
displaying news. If you are nerdy enough you can easily extend XBMC according
to your needs - by writing Python plugins.

**The components needed for a media center PC with XBMC**

For using XBMC you don't need a Media Center PC, you can actually download it
for any operating system (Windows, Mac OS, Linux) and test it directly on your
desktop PC, notebook, Mac Book and so on. But if you want to have a really
cool solution for your living room you need a media center pc which is capable
of handling HD content.

My Media Center PC consists of the following components:

  * Aplus Case Cupid 2, Mini-ITX-Desktop (with card reader and power supply) - 75 Euros
  * Asrock Mainboard A330ION, with nVidia ION Chipset incl. Atom330 and 2xDDR3-1066 slots, a PCIexpress slot and USB ports as well as Onboard 5.1 Surround Sound - 119 Euros
  * 2048 MB Kingston Ram KVR1333D3N9/2G - 49 Euros
  * Samsung drive SN-S083C DVD-Burner, Slim-Line, in order to fit in the small Aplus Case - 49 Euros
  * Western Digital HDD WD10EADS, 3,5" with 1 TB memory and 7200 cycles per minute - 84 Euros
  * DeLock Slim SATA Kabel - 5 Euros

Without any peripheral devices such as keyboard and mouse you will need to pay
381 Euros totally (this prices are now one year old). I was very lazy too, so
I paid an extra fee of 29 Euros to get that thing built together ;) In my
opinion that's a very small price for a Media Center PC - I think you will
agree to that!

**The software you need**

Depending on what you want to do with your Media Center PC, you can either use
Linux (it's fast, small and nerdy) or a current version of Microsoft's OS,
Windows Vista or Windows 7 - the hardware is capable of running the most
current version of Windows. When using Linux, please keep in mind that there
are problems with creative chipsets (soundcard). You should connect the PC
with the Television by using a HDMI-Cable.

After everything is installed and plugged in, you can now begin to download
XBMC from [xbmc.org](http://www.xbmc.org). There are also a lot of skins for
customizing XBMC according to your preferences. In the latest version there is
an integrated download solution for such content.

It's pretty uncool to control XBMC with a keyboard or a mouse, so you should
consider buying one of the following three devices: Wii-Mote controller, an
iPhone / iPod or an Android Phone. If you buy a smartphone, you can use either
the software solution for the [iPhone](http://www.appstoreapps.com/2008/09/13
/xbmc-remote/) or [Android](http://xbmc.org/freezy3k/2010/07/13/official-xbmc-
remote-for-android/). There is also a solution in progress for iPad.

**Games**

The media center PC is not only capable of playing videos and music. The
following games can also be played on the hardware without any problems thanks
to the nVidia ION Chipset:

*   Obscure 2
*   Civilization 4
*   Rise & Fall
*   Street Fighter 4 (low details and small resolution)
*   Age of Empires 2
*   Point and Click Adventures
*   You don't know Jack 4
*   Pro Evolution Soccer 2010
*   …
