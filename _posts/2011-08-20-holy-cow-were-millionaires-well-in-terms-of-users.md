> [Wow. This is amazing.](http://www.6wunderkinder.com/blog/2011/08/17/holy-cow-were-millionaires-well-in-terms-of-users/) It’s only been a year since we founded 6Wunderkinder and guess what? We’ve hit our first one million users within 275 days. The icing on the cake? We’ve hit this number sooner than companies like Evernote, Twitter and Foursquare did. We couldn’t be happier.  We knew at the very beginning that Wunderkit – a revolutionary, truly original take on productivity – would take at least a year of development, but we wanted to get something out right away.
