          <h4>29 May 2013</h4>

          <p><p>Yesterday my girlfriend and me went to the concert &#8216;The Legend of Zelda - Symphony of the Goddesses&#8217; performed by the Babelsberger Symphony Orchestra in the Tempodrom in Berlin. I didn&#8217;t expect too much from it but in the end I was really overwhelmed by the performance. I expected it to be a rather smallish concert but it was very epic. This was also due to the many Zelda fans that went to the concert. I am not a <strong>huge</strong> fan of Zelda myself, in fact I haven&#8217;t played anything past &#8216;Ocarina of Time&#8217; at all but I was playing &#8216;A Link to the Past&#8217; a lot during my childhood and with the music all the memories came back. I can highly recommend it. Next stop: Final Symphony from Final Fantasy!</p></p>

          <p><blockquote>
<p>Whatever the future of Valve turns out like, one thing is for certain – and it so happens that it constitutes the reason why I am personally excited to be part of Valve: The current system of corporate governance is bunk. Capitalist corporations are on the way to certain extinction. Replete with hierarchies that are exceedingly wasteful of human talent and energies, intertwined with toxic finance, co-dependent with political structures that are losing democratic legitimacy fast, a form of post-capitalist, decentralised corporation will, sooner or later, emerge.</p>
