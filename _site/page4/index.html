          <p><p>Today I wanted to simulate an external IP request with RSpec (2.8.0) and Rails (3.1). Unfortunately Google didn&#8217;t reveal much upon a search. So I came up with this solution:</p></p>

<p>All authority of any kind, especially in the field of thought and understanding, is the most destructive, evil thing. Leaders destroy the followers and followers destroy the leaders. You have to be your own teacher and your own disciple. You have to question everything that man has accepted as valuable, as necessary.</p>

          <p><blockquote>
<p>Beautiful is better than ugly. Explicit is better than implicit. Simple is better than complex. Complex is better than complicated. Flat is better than nested. Sparse is better than dense. Readability counts. Special cases aren&#8217;t special enough to break the rules. Although practicality beats purity. Errors should never pass silently. Unless explicitly silenced. In the face of ambiguity, refuse the temptation to guess. There should be one&#8211; and preferably only one &#8211;obvious way to do it. Although that way may not be obvious at first unless you&#8217;re Dutch. Now is better than never. Although never is often better than <em>right</em> now. If the implementation is hard to explain, it&#8217;s a bad idea. If the implementation is easy to explain, it may be a good idea. Namespaces are one honking great idea &#8211; let&#8217;s do more of those!</p>
