          <h4>17 Jul 2012</h4>

          <p><p>I have finally decided to root my Android phone and switch over to Ice Cream Sandwich. In the last few months I wasn&#8217;t willing to take the time to get into this whole rooting-and-custom-rom-stuff and risk any data loss. But Ice Cream Sandwich has been out for months and it takes HTC ages to put in their Sense UI - which I don&#8217;t even like very much. I think this UI feels kind of heavy.</p></p>

          <p><p>I experienced that whenever I inserted a DVD on my Ubuntu-driven HTPC and attempt to play it using XBMC I had a black screen without any visible menu or sound. When pressing the stop button, my computer froze completely. This bug is filed here:</p></p>

          <p><blockquote>
<p>Hammond was like every other management guy Arnold had ever seen. Whether it was Disney or the Navy, management guys always behaved the same. They never understood the technical issues; and they thought that screaming was the way to make things happen. And maybe it was, if you were shouting at your secretaries to get you a limousine. But screaming didn&#8217;t make any difference at all to the problems that Arnold now faced. The computer didn&#8217;t care if it was screamed at. The power network didn&#8217;t care if it was screamed at. Technical systems were completely indifferent to all this explosive human emotion. If anything, screaming was counterproductive, because Arnold now faced the virtual certainty that Nedry wasn&#8217;t coming back, which meant that Arnold himself had to go into the computer code and try and figure out what had gone wrong.</p>
