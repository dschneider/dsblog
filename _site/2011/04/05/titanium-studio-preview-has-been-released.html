<div id="post">
  <p>Jeff Haynie, the CEO of Appcelerator, told us at the <a href='http://www.6wunderkinder.com/wunderland/'>Wunderland</a> event last week that there will be a first Titanium Studio release &#8220;within the next few days&#8221;. He kept his word ;) a preview version was released yesterday.</p>

<p>I already downloaded it and had a look at it. The IDE is based on Aptana Studio (which has recently been bought by Appcelerator). Aptana itself is based on Eclipse. I must admit that I am not a fan of non-native IDEs (anymore) as they are a bit slow and lack the responsiveness and feeling of native IDEs. Nevertheless it&#8217;s an awesome IDE for developing software based on Appcelerator&#8217;s technology, Titanium. The IDE has the following features so far:</p>

<ul>
<li>i<strong>OS and Android debugging</strong></li>

<li><strong>Code completion for Titanium Mobile SDK methods</strong></li>

<li>Run, Deploy and Package Titanium Mobile and Titanium Desktop Applications</li>

<li>Full-featured HTML, JS, CSS, Ruby, PHP, and Python editing support</li>

<li>FTP/SFTP/FTPS/Capistrano deployment options</li>

<li>Integrated Git Support</li>

<li>Integrated Terminal</li>

<li>Fully scriptable and customizable</li>
</ul>

<p>You can have a look at the <a href='http://developer.appcelerator.com/blog/2011/04/titanium-studio-1-0
-preview-with-titanium-mobile-debugging.html'>official blog</a> post. There is also a video about the IDE which shows some basic stuff.</p>
