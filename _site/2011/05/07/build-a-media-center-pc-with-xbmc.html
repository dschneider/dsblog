  <p><strong>What is XBMC?</strong></p>

<p>XBMC Media Center is an open source media center solution for playing videos, music and showing pictures from DVD, hard disk, server and streams from the net. XBMC categorizes and organizes the media in a really beautiful way. For example XBMC fetches information about a movie or TV shows from IMDB and gets fanart content for music, movies and puts it right onto your screen. XBMC was initially developed for Microsoft&#8217;s Gaming Console XBox - hence the original name XBox Media Center.</p>

<p>You can scan your media library using so called &#8220;scrapers&#8221; which detect details about the movie / TV show by scanning the title of the file on your hard disk. XBMC automatically fetches the description, trailers, episode names and artists from the movies and TV shows, which you can use for searching afterwards - e. g. you can display all movies of Arnold Schwarzenegger at once! Awesome feature! It also loads the covers of your favorite music.</p>

<p>XBMC also has some other useful stuff like a weather plugin which shows the current weather in your city and region or an integrated RSS reader for displaying news. If you are nerdy enough you can easily extend XBMC according to your needs - by writing Python plugins.</p>

<p><strong>The components needed for a media center PC with XBMC</strong></p>

<p>For using XBMC you don&#8217;t need a Media Center PC, you can actually download it for any operating system (Windows, Mac OS, Linux) and test it directly on your desktop PC, notebook, Mac Book and so on. But if you want to have a really cool solution for your living room you need a media center pc which is capable of handling HD content.</p>

<p>My Media Center PC consists of the following components:</p>

<p>* Aplus Case Cupid 2, Mini-ITX-Desktop (with card reader and power supply) - 75 Euros * Asrock Mainboard A330ION, with nVidia ION Chipset incl. Atom330 and 2xDDR3-1066 slots, a PCIexpress slot and USB ports as well as Onboard 5.1 Surround Sound - 119 Euros * 2048 MB Kingston Ram KVR1333D3N9/2G - 49 Euros * Samsung drive SN-S083C DVD-Burner, Slim-Line, in order to fit in the small Aplus Case - 49 Euros * Western Digital HDD WD10EADS, 3,5&#8221; with 1 TB memory and 7200 cycles per minute - 84 Euros * DeLock Slim SATA Kabel - 5 Euros</p>

<p>Without any peripheral devices such as keyboard and mouse you will need to pay 381 Euros totally (this prices are now one year old). I was very lazy too, so I paid an extra fee of 29 Euros to get that thing built together ;) In my opinion that&#8217;s a very small price for a Media Center PC - I think you will agree to that!</p>

<p><strong>The software you need</strong></p>

<p>Depending on what you want to do with your Media Center PC, you can either use Linux (it&#8217;s fast, small and nerdy) or a current version of Microsoft&#8217;s OS, Windows Vista or Windows 7 - the hardware is capable of running the most current version of Windows. When using Linux, please keep in mind that there are problems with creative chipsets (soundcard). You should connect the PC with the Television by using a HDMI-Cable.</p>

<p>After everything is installed and plugged in, you can now begin to download XBMC from <a href='http://www.xbmc.org'>xbmc.org</a>. There are also a lot of skins for customizing XBMC according to your preferences. In the latest version there is an integrated download solution for such content.</p>

<p>It&#8217;s pretty uncool to control XBMC with a keyboard or a mouse, so you should consider buying one of the following three devices: Wii-Mote controller, an iPhone / iPod or an Android Phone. If you buy a smartphone, you can use either the software solution for the <a href='http://www.appstoreapps.com/2008/09/13
/xbmc-remote/'>iPhone</a> or <a href='http://xbmc.org/freezy3k/2010/07/13/official-xbmc-
remote-for-android/'>Android</a>. There is also a solution in progress for iPad.</p>

<p><strong>Games</strong></p>

<p>The media center PC is not only capable of playing videos and music. The following games can also be played on the hardware without any problems thanks to the nVidia ION Chipset:</p>

<ul>
<li>Obscure 2</li>

<li>Civilization 4</li>

<li>Rise &amp; Fall</li>

<li>Street Fighter 4 (low details and small resolution)</li>

<li>Age of Empires 2</li>

<li>Point and Click Adventures</li>

<li>You don&#8217;t know Jack 4</li>

<li>Pro Evolution Soccer 2010 * …</li>
</ul>
