<p>Hammond was like every other management guy Arnold had ever seen. Whether it was Disney or the Navy, management guys always behaved the same. They never understood the technical issues; and they thought that screaming was the way to make things happen. And maybe it was, if you were shouting at your secretaries to get you a limousine. But screaming didn&#8217;t make any difference at all to the problems that Arnold now faced. The computer didn&#8217;t care if it was screamed at. The power network didn&#8217;t care if it was screamed at. Technical systems were completely indifferent to all this explosive human emotion. If anything, screaming was counterproductive, because Arnold now faced the virtual certainty that Nedry wasn&#8217;t coming back, which meant that Arnold himself had to go into the computer code and try and figure out what had gone wrong.</p>
