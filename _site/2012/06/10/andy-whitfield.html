  <p>I am a huge fan of the TV show <strong>Spartacus: Blood and Sand. </strong>My girlfriend stumbled across this documentary that is currently being produced. It&#8217;s about the main actor of the TV show, Andy Whitfield, who died in 2011 (at the age of 39 years) because of Non Hodgkin&#8217;s Lymphoma. Andy was a truly inspiring human being. Check out the trailer above. You can also pledge money on <a href='http://www.kickstarter.com/projects/426354716/be-here-now-the-
andy-whitfield-story?ref=live'>Kickstarter</a> to fund the project.</p>

<p>From the project&#8217;s description:</p>

<p>“Be Here Now” is an inspiring feature documentary and love story, about the overnight sensation, actor and international sex symbol Andy Whitfield, who put the same determination and dedication that he brought to his lead role in the hit television show, “Spartacus: Blood and Sand,” into fighting life threatening cancer.</p>

<p>This is Andy&#8217;s story, but it also about having the courage to make your dreams come true, tackling your fears and living in the present, despite the potential outcome. This film is for anyone who has ever faced a challenge in their lives.</p>
