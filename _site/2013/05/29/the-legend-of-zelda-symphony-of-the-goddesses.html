<div id="post">
  <p>Yesterday my girlfriend and me went to the concert &#8216;The Legend of Zelda - Symphony of the Goddesses&#8217; performed by the Babelsberger Symphony Orchestra in the Tempodrom in Berlin. I didn&#8217;t expect too much from it but in the end I was really overwhelmed by the performance. I expected it to be a rather smallish concert but it was very epic. This was also due to the many Zelda fans that went to the concert. I am not a <strong>huge</strong> fan of Zelda myself, in fact I haven&#8217;t played anything past &#8216;Ocarina of Time&#8217; at all but I was playing &#8216;A Link to the Past&#8217; a lot during my childhood and with the music all the memories came back. I can highly recommend it. Next stop: Final Symphony from Final Fantasy!</p>
